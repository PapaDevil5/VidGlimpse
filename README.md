This project introduces a sophisticated video chat platform aimed at revolutionizing real-time communication using state-of-the-art technologies. By integrating WebRTC principles alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform seeks to redefine the parameters of seamless video interaction within web browsers. The core objective of this endeavour is to develop a robust architectural framework that ensures a secure, efficient, and user-centric video chat experience.

Leveraging WebRTC's capabilities, the platform establishes secure peer-to-peer connections, enabling smooth media stream handling and reliable communication channels. This foundational setup eliminates the need for external plugins, simplifying the communication process across a myriad of devices and platforms.
